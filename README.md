# LATEX Template

## Introduction

This project is a not-so-basic template for LATEX documents.

It has the common structure of a scientific/engineering document, so it is valid to start your Master or PhD. Thesis or any other complex document or book.

You should start inspecting **main.tex** file.  The final output should be a **main.pdf** file.


## Usage

If you don't have a clue about what LATEX is, I will simply recommend you two links to check:

* [LATEX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/)
* [LATEX Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)
* [LATEX Introduction](https://es.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
